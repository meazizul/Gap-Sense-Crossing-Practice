 * ADAPTIVE MARGIN OF ERROR

 *
 * The idea is behavioral shaping / zone of proximal development: hold the
 * student just past comfortable, but never so tight that the task becomes
 * impossible and demoralising.
 *
 *   CEILING  the margin the instructor set (default 0.40 s). The task never
 *            gets easier than this — it is the clinical target.
 *   FLOOR    a hard 0.10 s. Below this we would be measuring the student's
 *            reaction time and the touchscreen's latency, not their sense of
 *            duration, so tightening further would teach nothing.
 *   WINDOW   the last 10 attempts of the same activity, skill and street type.
 *
 * STATUS: EXPERIMENTAL, off by default. Cindi's review: there is
 * no research support for the window, the step or the stopping rule, and the
 * first version "pinned the learner down" and tightened too fast. What is
 * kept, per her notes:
 *
 *   - one margin PER TASK, SKILL AND STREET TYPE (a "lane"), never one
 *     overall; reproducing an interval, judging one, and tapping out a
 *     difference are different skills, and a 3 s half street is not an 8 s
 *     full street. "How much" estimates have their own lane
 *     ("compare-howmuch:full"), separate from the longer/shorter judgments;
 *   - tighten slowly (x 0.92 per window) and release quickly: a bad window
 *     goes straight back to the instructor's margin, not to a pinned level;
 *   - there is no learner floor any more; nothing holds a student down.
 *
 * Rules, evaluated after each attempt once the window is full:
 *
 *   accuracy >= 80%   tighten:  margin x 0.92, never below the hard floor
 *   accuracy <  60%   release:  margin = the instructor's margin (ceiling)
 *   60-80%            hold
