/* ============================================================
 * Gap Sense — Comparison tasks
 * ============================================================
 *
 * Knowing your own crossing time is the prerequisite skill. The skill it is a
 * prerequisite *for* is this one: judging whether the WARNING TIME of an
 * approaching vehicle (from first detecting it until it passes in front of
 * you) is longer, shorter, or about the same as the time you need to cross.
 *
 * Vocabulary (Cindi): the sound the app plays is a "sample
 * warning time". It is not a gap. A gap is the interval between two vehicles.
 *
 *   COMPARISON PRACTICE  anywhere, no traffic. The app plays a sample warning
 *                        time; the student judges it on a full-screen pad,
 *                        hears/feels/sees whether they were right, can tap
 *                        out how much longer or shorter (only after a correct
 *                        longer/shorter answer), then feels it in a replay.
 *   AT THE STREET        a real vehicle. The student swipes toward the side
 *                        it comes from when they think they detect it, taps
 *                        when it passes in front of them, then makes the same
 *                        judgment. The app never gives the answer first.
 *
 * Sounds and what they mean (build 7):
 *   the sample            one steady sound, one loudness, no fade
 *   "this is your time"   the student's own marker sound and flash
 *   right / wrong         the within-margin chime / outside-margin pulse,
 *                         with the circle / triangle when visual is on
 *
 * Every timer belonging to a flow is tracked so that restarting, or leaving
 * the screen, cancels the flow cleanly. Nothing auto-advances.

 * Full-screen pads
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Design requirements (Cindi, Oct 2026; tracker 12.27, 12.28, 12.31, 13.7):
 *   - A pad covers the whole screen and never scrolls (a drag is a gesture).
 *   - With swipes on (the default), everything below the pad's header is the
 *     swipe area and there are no answer buttons. With swipes off, set by
 *     the instructor, the pad shows buttons only.
 *   - Back, in the top-left corner of every pad and outside the swipe area,
 *     is the one way out. It goes up one level and records the cancelled
 *     part as cancelled, never scored. Escape, Android's Back and
 *     VoiceOver's two-finger scrub do the same as Back. The way out is for
 *     a try that was interrupted or started by mistake; a student who is
 *     unsure gives their best judgment.
 *   - Focus is never left on a control that is about to disappear: a pad
 *     remembers what opened it and hands focus on before it hides.
 *   - When a pad opens, the screen reader's cursor goes to the swipe area:
 *     on iPhone the native Direct Touch area, elsewhere the page's own.
 * <main> is made inert while a pad is open.

 * view marked for direct interaction over the pad's swipe area whenever a
 * pad is open. The student turns Direct Touch on for Gap Sense once
 * (VoiceOver rotor); from then on a swipe in that area reaches the app
 * unchanged. The native side classifies the gesture with the same
 * thresholds as the web pad and reports how long the finger was down, so
 * the vehicle is still timed from the touch, not the lift.
 *
 * Build 14 (tracker 12.28, 13.2, 13.3, 13.6): when a pad opens, the app
 * asks the iPhone to move the VoiceOver cursor onto the area, so VoiceOver
 * reads the area's label first and the first tap or swipe already counts.
 * When a pad closes, the area is taken out of the view tree and VoiceOver
 * is told the layout changed, so no invisible area is left over the screen.

 * ------------------------------------------------------------

 *   - no microphone, no "quiet level": accuracy depended on how the phone
 *     was held, and judging the conditions is taught by the instructor;
 *   - the student marks hearing or vision, saved with each vehicle;
 *   - detection is a swipe toward the side the vehicle comes from (left: the
 *     first half of the street; right: the full street), arrival is a tap,
 *     "it never came" is a swipe down. Buttons do the same for screen
 *     readers;
 *   - after arrival the STUDENT judges longer / shorter / about the same,
 *     exactly as in Comparison practice; the app does not give the answer;
 *   - replays: after every vehicle, only after an error, or never.
