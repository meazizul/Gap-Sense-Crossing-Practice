# Changelog — Gap Sense: Crossing Practice

What changed, why, and when. Newest first.

The original project was not under version control (it arrived as a ZIP export),
so dates before this file existed were reconstructed from file timestamps rather
than commit history. They are accurate to the day.

## Unreleased (next build) — The "how much" Combined replay plays the warning time (GitHub issue 11)

Cindi Lashinsky reported (GitHub issue 11) that in build 13 the Combined replay
after a "how much longer or shorter" estimate played the steady sound for the
student's crossing time. The student had just heard that same sound play for
the warning time as the sample, so the one sound changed meaning within a
single trial. The rule is that the steady sound always stands for the warning
time: in the sample, in the longer/shorter replay, and now in this replay too.

- **The steady sound is the sample warning time** in the Combined replay, in
  Comparison practice and At the street (which share the replay). The
  student's own sound lands where their crossing time ends, as in the
  longer/shorter replay, and again at the crossing time plus or minus their
  estimate, which is where they thought the warning time ended. The chime or
  low pulse stays where the warning time really ended. Example: crossing 6 s,
  sample 8.5 s, estimate 3.5 s: sound 0 to 8.5 s, student's sound at 6 s and
  9.5 s, low pulse at 8.5 s.
- The status line, the Instructor setup note and the guides describe the new
  order. Tests: `tests/issue11-how-much-replay.spec.mjs` (fails on build 13).

## 2026-10-18 (build 13: iOS, Android, web) — The 26 bugs from the 17 October review (bugs 14 to 39)

A second review of build 12, from Cindi Lashinsky's side and done in browser
emulation rather than on a phone, found 26 more bugs. Every one
was confirmed in the build 12 code before it was fixed here. The acceptance
tests from that review are now part of the test suite (`tests/oct17-review.spec.mjs`
and the two regression files beside it), so each fix has a test that failed on
build 12 and passes now.

- **Pads fit the screen at every text size and in landscape (bug 24, 25).**
  At 200 to 300 percent text, and in landscape at normal text, the answer
  buttons and Skip were below the bottom of the screen and the pad could not
  scroll. The pads now cap their text at about twice the normal size, the
  arrows go at large text, and in landscape the swipe area sits beside the
  controls. Skip keeps its word on one line. Checked across 75 phone-size,
  text-size and phase combinations: every control reachable (was 61 of 75
  unreachable).
- **Shorter setup link (bug 14).** The texted link was about 650 characters
  with periods inside, and Messages could break it. The new link (format 4)
  is about 150 characters with no periods; the features travel as a short
  code. The app also ignores a full stop, bracket, space or line break added
  by a messaging app, and refuses a damaged link rather than half applying
  it. Links from builds 9 to 12 still open. The message text puts the link
  alone on its last line.
- **Every way out stops the sound (bug 31).** Changing the crossing during a
  replay, pressing Done at the street, Ready in Comparison preparation, or
  hiding the app during a Practice replay now silences scheduled sounds, as
  Back already did.
- **Latency is subtracted only when the cue is a sound (bug 29).** With
  visual-only feedback nothing is subtracted; the channel is saved with each
  attempt. **Headphone delay is re-read on every Ready (bug 19)**, and the
  iPhone app also re-reads it when the audio route changes.
- **Replay B keeps both halves on screen (bug 30).** The second visual
  replay joins the first timeline instead of erasing it.
- **Only the top pad can be reached (bug 28).** With the answer pad over the
  street pad, the street pad is inert and hidden from screen readers; focus
  returns to it when the answer pad closes.
- **Progress and days practiced count every record (bugs 15, 23).** Skipped
  answers, skipped estimates and unjudged vehicles show as "N skipped" and
  "N not scored"; "Nothing recorded yet" appears only when the log is empty.
  Skipped estimates are counted apart from skipped answers.
- **Honest messages (bugs 16, 17, 21, 36).** Hidden during "how much" or a
  replay, the app says the answer was saved. The Skip buttons say "Noted as
  skipped, not scored." Sharing with the lock ticked but no instructor code
  says the link locks nothing. A failed copy says "Could not copy" and shows
  the text to select, instead of claiming success.
- **One check for the setup (bugs 32, 33).** A margin of 0 or an empty
  margin, a crossing time over 600 s, or a first-half time not shorter than
  the full-street time is refused with a reason, on the form, on Home, and
  in setup links alike. Nothing is silently replaced with 0.4 s.
- **Arrival vibrates once (bug 18)**, like the detection swipe.
- **Android Back (bug 20).** The Back button and gesture now close a dialog,
  skip an open pad, leave the street pad, go Home, and from Home put the app
  in the background. Before, Back did nothing.
- **Stay-awake request answered late (bug 22).** A screen lock granted after
  the pad closed is released at once (web and Android).
- **High contrast keeps a dark theme dark (bug 26).** Dark or Inverted with
  High contrast is white or yellow on black, and the iPhone status bar text
  stays readable. **Input borders at 3:1 (bug 34)** on every theme. **Forced
  colors (bug 27)** no longer blank the visual replay on Windows.
- **Deleting history clears the report preview (bug 35)**, so a deleted
  attempt can no longer be sent.
- **Pinch zoom is on in the phone apps (bug 37).** Double-tap zoom stays off
  through the stylesheet. The Direct Touch area follows the zoom and the
  screen position.
- **The Direct Touch area follows the street pad (bug 38)** when its text
  changes after a vehicle is detected, and on rotation or scrolling.
- **Halfway-and-finish shows a score for both marks (bug 39).**

## 2026-10-16 (build 12: iOS, Android, web) — Swipes work the same with VoiceOver on (iPhone)

Cindi Lashinsky's design: swipes and taps must work the same whether a screen
reader is on or off. At a curb, one-handed, with a cane or a dog, hunting for
a button is not workable. A web page cannot receive raw swipes under
VoiceOver, so until now screen reader users had buttons instead.

- **A native direct-touch area.** Whenever a pad is open, the iPhone app lays
  a transparent native view marked for direct interaction over the pad's
  gesture surface: the street surface, the answer surface, and the "how much"
  button. With VoiceOver on, touches inside it reach the app unchanged. A
  swipe left is a vehicle from the left, a tap is "it passed", swipe up is
  "longer", and so on, the same as without VoiceOver. The native side
  measures how long the finger was down, so the vehicle is still timed from
  the touch, not the lift.
- **One-time setup.** VoiceOver users turn on Direct Touch for Gap Sense once
  (VoiceOver rotor, Direct Touch). Help says so. The buttons are still there.
- Android with TalkBack is unchanged: the gesture route there is still
  unresolved.
- No change on the web, which has no screen-reader-safe swipe path.

## 2026-10-16 (build 11: iOS, Android, web) — A skipped answer is recorded as skipped

Cindi Lashinsky's rule: every answer screen has a way out, and leaving is
recorded. Build 10 added Skip but recorded nothing. Build 11 records the skip.

- **Skip is noted, never scored.** A skipped longer/shorter/same answer, or a
  skipped "how much" estimate, goes into the log marked skipped. It appears in
  the report's recent list ("skipped the answer (not scored)", with the
  warning time at the street) and as a count per activity ("At the street: 2
  skipped"), and on the Progress cards. It is left out of every score, the
  last-ten windows, the street tally and the adaptive lanes.
- Skipping "how much" keeps the judgment already given, as before.

## 2026-10-16 (build 10: iOS, Android, web) — Scoring, timing and street fixes from Cindi Lashinsky's review of build 9

Cindi Lashinsky reviewed build 9 in detail: how the app records and scores
practice, and eleven bugs found by running it. Build 10 fixes all of them
that are code. The first group is about scoring and reporting; the second is
about timing, sound and the street.

**Timing, sound and the street**

- **The warning time starts when the finger touches the screen**, not when
  it lifts at the end of the swipe. A 0.3 s swipe used to make the warning
  time 0.3 s shorter, so a right answer near the margin could be marked
  wrong. The arrival tap is measured the same way.
- **Headphone delay is taken off the measured time** in Comparison
  preparation instead of widening the margin on both sides. With Bluetooth
  (about 0.2 s), a student who stopped 0.6 s early was told "within the
  margin"; now the screen, the record and the replay all agree.
- **Back silences the sound.** Leaving a screen during a replay used to let
  its sounds play on into the next screen for up to the length of the replay.
  Every scheduled sound and the steady sample stop at once, in the iPhone
  app's player too.
- **The screen stays awake while a pad is open.** At the street a student may
  wait minutes for a vehicle; the phone no longer locks in that time. If the
  app is hidden anyway (a call, another app), the vehicle or sample being
  timed is dropped unrecorded rather than timed on in the background.
- **Skip on the answer pads.** "Was it longer, shorter or about the same?" and
  "How much?" have a Skip button, and Escape does the same. (Corrected 22 Oct
  2026: this entry used to say a student is "never made to guess" and that
  nothing is recorded. Neither was the design: the way out is for an
  interrupted try, a student who is unsure gives their best judgment, and a
  skipped try is recorded and never scored, as build 11 itself did. In build
  14 Skip became Back; see the build 14 entry.)
- **Quiet confirmation at the street.** The instructor can set swipe and tap
  confirmation to vibration only, so nothing sounds while the student is
  listening for traffic. The default keeps the short sound.
- **A setup link can lock the student's Instructor setup.** When the
  instructor has set a code, the link carries it (as a hash, never the code)
  and the student's phone asks for it before any setting can be changed. A
  tick box under "Send this setup to the student" controls this.
- **"Days practiced" uses the phone's own date.** An evening's practice
  counted as two days east of the date line in UTC terms.
- **Section headings are real headings.** Instructor setup, Help, Progress
  and the Settings and Accessibility dialogs use h2/h3 for their sections, and
  each box is a labelled group, so VoiceOver's headings rotor can jump between
  them. The look is unchanged.

**Scoring and reporting**

Nothing changes in how an activity is played; what changes is what the
scores, the adaptive margin and the report are built from.

- **Judging and "how much" are scored as two skills.** Judging a sample as
  longer, shorter or about the same, and tapping out how much longer or
  shorter, were recorded under one activity and counted together. Now each
  score, each adaptive lane and each report line keeps them apart. The
  Comparison practice score reads, for example, "Last 10: 70% correct · how
  much: 2 of 5 within margin".
- **One vehicle is one attempt.** A "how much" estimate after a correct answer
  is the same vehicle or sample judged a second way. It no longer adds to the
  total or the accuracy. The report shows it on its own line: "At the street:
  7/10 correct" and "At the street, how much: 4/7 within margin".
- **The last ten means the last ten judgments.** The Comparison practice score
  used to cut the last ten entries first and then drop the "how much" ones, so
  it could show fewer than ten even when ten judgments existed.
- **The replay repeats the verdict.** In Comparison preparation the app allows
  a small timing tolerance (0.02 s, or the measured sound latency) when it
  decides within or outside the margin. The replay recomputed the verdict
  without that tolerance, so an attempt just past the margin could get the
  chime and then the buzz. The replay now repeats the verdict already given.
- **"How much" has its own adaptive lane** ("Comparison practice, how much,
  full street"), starting from the set margin. Existing lanes keep their
  values. Adaptive mode is still experimental and off by default.
- **Old street records** from builds before 7 are now reported as "longer than
  the crossing", "about the same as the crossing" or "shorter than the
  crossing", with no verdict on whether the warning was enough. The app never
  makes that call.
- A report is produced whenever anything is in the log, including vehicles
  that never came or warning times recorded with judging off.

## 2026-10-16 (build 9: iOS, Android, web) — Louder sound, stronger vibration, sound with the silent switch on

From testing build 8 on an iPhone: the sound was too quiet and the vibration
too faint. Cindi had also felt the cues but heard nothing.

- **Sound on iPhone is played by the app itself**, not the web view. WebKit
  could put Web Audio in the audio session that the ring/silent switch mutes.
  The app's own player uses the `playback` session, which the switch never
  mutes, restores it if anything changes it, and restarts after calls, Siri
  and headphone changes. "Get ready" and self-voicing are spoken by the app
  for the same reason.
- **Louder.** Every cue passes through a soft clipper: the steady sample is
  about 7 dB louder and the chimes about 5 dB, with no crackling. The sample
  itself is also set higher.
- **Phone volume note.** The app cannot raise the phone's volume. When it is
  below half, Home asks the student to press volume up; the note goes away as
  soon as they do. **Play a test sound** now reports whether sound is on, that
  the silent switch does not affect it, and the phone volume.
- **Stronger vibration.** Each iPhone knock is a sharp tap plus a short
  full-strength rumble; the "wrong" buzz is 600 ms. Android vibrates for set
  lengths (60–550 ms) instead of a short click. Same rhythms as before.

## 2026-10-16 (build 8: iOS, Android, web) — Polish after device testing

Build 7 was run end to end inside the app on twelve simulated iPhones (iPhone
14 Pro Max, 15, 16, 17, 17e, 18 Pro, 18 Pro Max, Air, SE and 16e, on iOS
26.0, 26.4 and 27). Every check passed. Build 8 carries the small fixes found
while looking at the screenshots:

- At 300% text the header filled the whole first screen. It is now one
  compact row (title 24 px, buttons 52 px); the content keeps the chosen size.
- No focus box drawn around titles that take focus for screen readers.
- "Student code" wording on the Progress screen, to match Instructor setup.
- The native app can run a scripted self-check when launched with a
  developer-only argument; normal use never triggers it.

## 2026-10-16 (build 7: iOS, Android, web) — Second round of O&M feedback

A second detailed review by Cindi Lashinsky (O&M Specialist), with input from
Dona Sauerburger on the at-the-street procedure. Every point is addressed below.
The same code runs on all three: iOS build 7, Android versionCode 7, and the web
page.

**Names and wording**

- "Practise my timing" is now **Practice my timing**. "Time it from a signal"
  is now **Comparison preparation**: to an O&M Specialist, "signal" means a
  traffic signal, and this app is about uncontrolled crossings. "Compare
  practice" is now **Comparison practice**.
- American English throughout (practice, curb, traveler, judgment).
- New task descriptions on Home, written by Cindi.
- The app name ("Gap Sense") is kept for now. It is under discussion, because
  "gap" means the time between vehicles in published work. The name is held in
  one place in the code so a rename is a small change.

**Use with an O&M Specialist**

- A first-run notice: the app is for use under the guidance of an Orientation
  and Mobility Specialist, is not a replacement for instruction, and does not
  cover all the skills needed to cross streets. It cannot be skipped with
  Escape and is shown on first run even from the conference link. Home carries
  the same line permanently. Help can show it again.
- On Comparison practice and At the street: **"Longer does not mean long
  enough."** A longer warning time is not, by itself, enough to cross. Shown
  until the student hides it; Help brings it back.

**Instructor setup (new screen)**

- Crossing times, margin, instructor email and student code moved here from
  Settings.
- The instructor chooses which activities the student sees, which Practice
  modes are offered, and for each option: on, off, or student chooses. Options
  the instructor fixes are hidden from the student, with a short note.
- Optional instructor code (digits) so a student cannot change the setup. It
  locks again on leaving the screen.

**Setup link and report**

- The setup link (version 3) can carry any of: crossing times and margin,
  instructor email and student code, and the activities and options chosen.
  The instructor ticks what to include. Version 1 and 2 links still work.
- **Share the setup link** opens the phone's share sheet. **Text it to the
  student** opens Messages with the message filled in; the instructor adds
  the number.
- Links made inside the installed app point at the public web address, never
  at the app's internal address.
- After a browser applies a setup, it offers **Open in the Gap Sense app**,
  which hands the same setup to the installed app through a `gapsense://` link.
- **Send my progress to my instructor**: the student sees the report, presses
  **Send it**, and chooses Messages, Mail or any app. No copy and paste, no
  Mail setup needed, and no server.

**Comparison preparation**

- Pressing Ready says **"Get ready"** out loud (and two light taps), instead of
  a beep that sounded like the other cues.
- The sound can be the same steady sound used in Comparison practice, playing
  until the student stops it, like hearing a vehicle and deciding "now I would
  finish crossing". Or one short beep, then silence. Instructor or student
  chooses.
- Wait times mix quick (0.7–2 s), medium (2–5 s) and long (5–10 s), never the
  same band three times in a row.
- If nobody presses, the sound stops by itself and nothing is recorded.

**Comparison practice**

- The sample is **one steady sound at one loudness**, with no fade in or out,
  so a student with any hearing loss hears all of it. Loudness defaults to
  100%. A **pitch** control (lowest to high) is shared with Comparison
  preparation.
- Answers open a **full-screen swipe pad** that never scrolls the page: swipe up
  for longer, down for shorter, tap for about the same. Three large buttons sit
  on the pad for VoiceOver and TalkBack users, with focus on the middle one.
  The instructor can choose buttons only.
- Right or wrong is given at once on every channel: the chime or the low pulse,
  the haptic pattern, and, with visual on, the circle or the triangle.
- The replay no longer plays a right/wrong cue at the crossing time. It plays
  the sample, and the student's own "this is your time" sound and flash where
  their crossing time ends.
- **How much longer or shorter** is offered only after a correct "longer" or
  "shorter" answer.
- Two replays after "how much", chosen by the instructor: (a) combined, Cindi's
  design: a steady sound for the crossing time, the right or wrong sound where
  the sample ended, and the student's sound at the crossing time plus or minus
  their estimate; or (b) like Practice my timing.
- The sample on screen is a held bar, distinct from the student's own flash.

**At the street (reworked with Cindi and Dona)**

- The background-noise check is gone, and with it all microphone use and the
  microphone permission on iOS and Android. Accuracy depended on how the phone
  was held, and judging conditions is taught by the instructor.
- New wording: position yourself as directed by your O&M Specialist; tap when
  you *think* you detect (see or hear) a vehicle.
- The student marks **hearing or vision**; it is saved with each vehicle.
- A full-screen pad: **swipe left or right** toward the side the vehicle comes
  from (left compares with the first half of the street, right with the full
  street), **tap** when it passes in front of you, **swipe down** if it never
  came. Buttons do the same for screen reader users.
- After arrival the **student judges** longer, shorter or about the same. The
  app does not give the answer first. "How much" follows a correct
  longer/shorter answer if switched on.
- Replays: after every vehicle, only after a wrong answer, or never (then only
  the right or wrong sound).
- Reports show direction, hearing or vision, the judgment, and vehicles that
  never came. Only judged vehicles count towards a score.

**Accessibility**

- **Self-voicing**: the app can speak its own directions and results, with a
  speaking rate, for students still learning VoiceOver or TalkBack. Speech
  stops whenever a sound is being timed.
- Home activities are single buttons whose name is the title and the
  description, so VoiceOver reads one item per activity. The hidden "Home"
  heading is gone; focus moves to the visible screen title on every screen.
- **Siri**: "Practice my timing in Gap Sense", "Comparison preparation in Gap
  Sense", "Comparison practice in Gap Sense", "At the street in Gap Sense" work
  with no setup, and appear in the Shortcuts app. A **Siri and shortcuts**
  screen explains them. On Android, touch and hold the app icon for the same
  four shortcuts.

**Haptics and sound on iPhone**

- A small Gap Sense plugin now plays every haptic cue through one long-lived
  Core Haptics engine that plays haptics only and never touches audio. The
  stock plugin built a new engine for every long buzz, freed it at once, and
  shared the audio session with the web view.
- Vibration is switched back on, once, for anyone upgrading with an old "off"
  stored from an early build. Turning it off again from build 7 is respected.
- The sound engine now resumes after iOS interrupts it (a call, Siri, another
  app). Before, one interruption could leave the app silent until relaunch.
- The installed app tells WebKit it is a playback app, so the ringer switch
  does not mute it. The silent-audio workaround now runs only on iOS 16.
- Accessibility has a **Play a test sound** button that also reports the state
  of the sound engine.

**Tests**

- The browser test suite grew from 42 to 74 tests, covering every change above.
  The iOS build was launched in the iOS 27 simulator on an iPhone 14 Pro Max
  with a built-in self-check (plugins present, sound running in playback mode,
  speech available, Siri path opening the right screen). The Android build was
  launched on an Android 15 emulator, with a `gapsense://` link and the four
  launcher shortcuts checked.

## 2026-10-14 (iOS build 6) — Hardened for every iPhone and iPad a participant might bring

After the iOS 27 crash, the native shell was audited for anything else that
could stop the app opening on a participant's phone.

- **Minimum iOS pinned to 16.0.** It was left to Xcode, which silently chose
  iOS 17, so anyone on iOS 16 (iPhone 8, 8 Plus, X) could not install it. The
  web code was checked against iOS 16 WebKit: everything it uses is supported
  from iOS 15.4, and the one newer CSS feature already had a fallback.
- **Device requirement corrected** from `armv7` (a 32-bit leftover in the
  template) to `arm64`.
- **Launch tested in the simulator** on 11 models on iOS 27 (iPhone SE 2nd
  and 3rd generation, 11, 13 mini, 14 Pro Max, 16e, 17 Pro Max, Air, iPad
  A16, iPad mini, iPad Pro 13-inch) and 7 models each on iOS 26.0 and 26.4:
  first launch, a second cold launch, and background then foreground, with
  no crash reports and the home screen rendered.
- Checked that the app package contains every web file and Capacitor's
  bridge scripts, whose absence is the only other way Capacitor aborts at
  launch.

Apple does not provide iOS 16, 17 or 18 simulators for the current Xcode, so
those versions are covered by the build settings and the web-feature check
rather than a simulated launch.

## 2026-10-14 (iOS build 5) — Launch crash on iOS 27 fixed

A tester on an iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 27.0.1 reported "crashes as soon
as I try to open it". The TestFlight crash log shows an `EXC_BREAKPOINT` on
the main thread inside UIKit's `EvaluateRuntimeIssueForNoSceneLifecycleAdoption`
during scene creation. On iOS 27, an app built with the current SDK that has
not adopted the UIScene lifecycle is terminated at launch. The Capacitor shell
still used the app-delegate-only lifecycle, so every launch on iOS 27 died
before the web view existed. Devices on iOS 26 were unaffected, which is why
it passed device checks here. Reproduced in the iOS 27.0 simulator, where the
same frame appeared within a second of launch.

Fix: `Info.plist` declares a `UIApplicationSceneManifest` (single scene, the
existing `Main` storyboard), and `AppDelegate.swift` gains the scene
configuration hook and a `SceneDelegate` that forwards URL opens and user
activities to Capacitor. No web code changed; Android is unaffected.

## 2026-10-10 (build 4) — Vibration on by default, no zoom trap, visible build number

Found while testing build 3, within minutes of it going live.

- **Vibration is on from the first launch.** It was off until someone found the
  switch under Accessibility. For a DeafBlind user it is the whole interface,
  so the default is now on; an explicit opt-out is still remembered.
- **Double-tap no longer zooms the iPhone app.** A double tap anywhere zoomed
  the web view and there was no way back except relaunching. The native shell
  now locks the viewport (WKWebView honors `user-scalable=no`; Safari does
  not, so the web build is untouched and still pinch-zooms), and
  `touch-action: manipulation` on the page removes double-tap zoom everywhere
  while keeping pinch. Capacitor's `zoomEnabled` is set to false as well.
- **Help → About shows the version and build**, read from the app bundle in
  the native apps ("Gap Sense version 1.0, build 4 (iPhone app)"), so a tester
  can confirm which build they are running. TestFlight itself only shows
  "1.0" prominently.
- iOS build 4, Android versionCode 4, service-worker cache v6. 41 browser tests.

## 2026-10-10 — Cindi's review: measuring removed, a signal activity, overlapped replays, privacy in the share link

Cindi reviewed the four activities in detail. Everything below
follows from that review and from a code review the same week. All three bugs
she reported were real.

### Measure my crossing is gone

She was clear: determining the crossing time is the instructor's job. They time
at least three crossings and use the **longest** ("if it took that long once, it
may take that long another time"), and the start, halfway and finish points are
chosen precisely, not by a student pressing buttons while crossing. The step,
its screen and `measure.js` were removed. Settings now says who sets the times
and how; the Home screen points a new user to Settings or to the instructor's
link. Home has four steps again: Practise, Time it from a signal, Compare, At
the street.

### New: Time it from a signal

The first step of her proposed comparison structure: judging time when you do
*not* control the start, the way she teaches at the kerb ("you hear a car
coming… wait… now"). Press **Ready**; after a random wait (1.5–4 s, or 3–8 s
with "Longer waits") the signal comes — two quick blips, a pulse, a flash — and
the student presses when their crossing time is up. Then an overlapped replay,
exactly as in Practice. A press before the signal is a false start and records
nothing. Logged as its own activity with its own progress and margin lane.

### Practice: three bugs fixed

Practice never wrote to the attempt log, so nothing reached the Progress page,
there was no score line, and the adaptive margin could not apply to it. It now
logs every mark (Halfway → first-half lane, Finish → full-street lane), shows
"Last N: X within margin · margin …" under the button, and classifies against
the per-lane margin. The first tone could also land late on the very first
press: the audio engine was created suspended and the first tap waited for it to
resume. It is now created at load and warmed on the first touch.

### Compare practice, rebuilt around "sample warning time"

- **Words.** A gap is the interval between vehicles. What the app plays is a
  **sample warning time**: from first hearing a vehicle until it passes. The
  button is **Play a sample warning time**; "gap" is gone from the interface.
- **Nothing auto-advances.** A new trial used to start by itself 1.4 s after a
  correct answer. The student now presses Play for each one.
- **Overlapped replay, after every answer.** The old replay played the sample
  and then the crossing time back to back, and marked the crossing with the
  within-margin chime at both ends — so a wrong answer ended with two "you were
  close" sounds, the confusing "duplicated sounds" she heard. Now the sample and
  the real crossing time start together, as in Practice: a marker at the start,
  the sample, a marker where it ends, and the feedback cue where the crossing
  time ends (chime if within the margin, low pulse if not). The order of the
  last two sounds is the direction; the distance between them is the magnitude.
  Sight and touch follow the same timeline.
- **The sound of a vehicle.** The continuous sample now grows from quiet to
  loud and stops dead, instead of a steady tone that faded ("the opposite of
  vehicles"). A **Sample loudness** slider with a two-second preview sets where
  the quiet start becomes audible. Two taps with silence between remain an
  option.
- **Answering quickly.** Besides the three buttons, an answer pad takes a swipe
  up for longer, a swipe down for shorter, a tap for about the same (arrow keys
  on a keyboard). Under VoiceOver or TalkBack a web page cannot receive raw
  swipes, so focus lands on **About the same** when answers open; one flick
  reaches either other answer.
- **Random pause** before the sample (optional), and the **how much** step now
  runs before the replay, as she sketched: tap out the difference, hear the
  comparison replay, then your estimate against the real difference.
- Replays now hold a flash for the whole sample and show the acceptable or
  outside shape at the crossing time, so Deaf users see the comparison too.

### At the street

Direction labels now read "Approaching from the left — compared with the first
half of the street" and "from the right — compared with the full street"; the
mapping was right, the words were not. The verdict is followed by the overlapped
replay. The **background-noise check is experimental and off by default**: she
doubts it survives real phones, pockets and hands. The microphone is opened only
while the check is on and the screen is showing, and is released on leaving —
previously it could stay open if the user left before the permission prompt
resolved.

### Adaptive margin: experimental, per task, slower, never pinned

Her longest note: no research supports the window, the step or the stopping
rule; the first version "pinned the learner down" and tightened too fast. The
feature is now marked experimental and off by default, with a margin **per
activity and street type**. It tightens by × 0.92 once per **block of ten**
attempts at ≥ 80% (the old code re-evaluated after every attempt once ten
existed, which is why it felt fast), holds between 60 and 80%, and on a block
below 60% goes **straight back to the instructor's margin**. The learner floor
is gone; **Reset adaptive margins** in Progress starts every lane again.

### Share link and report: a code, never a name

The link travels by plain email or text. The student name field is gone. Settings
has **Instructor email** and a **Client code** (letters and digits, up to 8);
both ride in the version-2 link and the code heads the report. Old version-1
links still import. Progress gained **Email it to my instructor**, which opens
the phone's mail app with the report filled in; the student still presses Send.
Live vehicles in the report are described as verdicts (enough / not enough
warning), not as "incorrect" answers.

### Smaller fixes

- Screen-reader announcements are spoken immediately. The old announcer waited
  20 ms and re-checked a suppression flag, so any message followed by a replay —
  including the correct answer in Compare — was never spoken.
- Leaving a screen mid-activity now cancels it: Settings no longer stays
  disabled after backing out of Practice, no timers keep running, speech is
  un-suppressed, the microphone closes.
- Home shows "Crossing times set" rather than the numbers; the numbers live in
  Settings, so a student is not invited to count.
- Dark theme: the completed marker glyph was white on light green (~1.9:1); it
  uses dark ink now. The action-button hint is at full opacity. Copy buttons are
  44 px.
- The silent-switch keep-alive runs only in the installed app, where it belongs;
  in Safari it would have silenced the user's own music.
- Settings copy: "Measured and set by the O&M instructor…"; margin: "Chosen and
  set by the instructor. 0.50 s has historically been taught; there is no
  research yet on the right value." Default stays 0.40 s.
- Tutorial gained "A sample warning time" and "The start signal".

### Engineering

- **Browser tests.** `cd ios-app && npm test` runs 38 Playwright tests in the
  installed Google Chrome: every screen and dialog, the demo link, Practice
  logging and margins, leaving mid-run, announcements, Compare (no auto-advance,
  replay, swipe and keys, how much, random pause, cancel), the signal activity,
  At the street (verdicts, microphone closed, noise check on/off, the permission
  race), share link v2 and rejection of bad links, the report, deleting data,
  the adaptive maths, and the visual-only / 300% / high-contrast / reduced-motion
  configuration. Not covered: real audio, haptics, VoiceOver.
- `npm run sync` syncs iOS and Android. Service-worker cache `gapsense-v5`.
  iOS build 3, Android versionCode 3. `signal.js` added, `measure.js` removed.

## 2026-10-09 — App-bar header, build 2

The header became a sticky app bar with a back button, the screen title and the
Settings and Accessibility icons. iOS build number 2; Android released as
`v1.0-build2`.

---

## 2026-10-05 — Edge to edge on iOS, stronger haptics, silent switch

White bands above and below the web view are gone (edge-to-edge web view, dark
first paint). Haptics strengthened: heavy knock for a tap, three heavy knocks
within the margin, a 450 ms Core Haptics buzz outside it. A looping silent clip
moves WebKit to a playback audio session so tones play with the silent switch
on. `ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING=NO` so the CocoaPods embed script runs under
Xcode 27.

---

## 2026-09-28 — Replay haptics for DeafBlind users; Android project

During replay the app vibrated at the reference moment but not at the student's
own tap, so someone relying on touch alone felt one pulse with nothing to compare
it against. Both now pulse. The native Android project was added under
`ios-app/android/`.

---

## 2026-09-27 — The rest of the training sequence

Until now the app covered one activity: practising your crossing time. The
feature proposal describes four, and a meeting with Cindi confirmed a step was
missing *before* the one that existed. All four now ship.

### The missing first step: Measure my crossing

The app used to *begin* from two numbers an instructor measured with a stopwatch
and typed into Settings — the one place the whole method still depended on
counting seconds, and the reason a student could never set themselves up at a new
street alone. There is now a mode that walks the crossing: tap at each point,
repeat, and the app averages the walks, warns if they are inconsistent, plays the
duration back so the felt sense starts immediately, and saves it as the reference.

### Practice Comparison Task

The app plays a gap representing a vehicle's warning time; the student judges it
longer, shorter, or about the same as their crossing. Categories are drawn evenly
so no base rate can be learned, and magnitudes scale with the crossing time.
A wrong answer replays the gap and the crossing time back to back so the error is
felt. An optional follow-up asks the student to tap out *how much* longer or
shorter. The gap can be one continuous sound or two taps with silence between,
because which reads better is genuinely unresolved.

### Actual Comparison Task — at the street

Direction set first (left compares to half street, right to full), then one large
button: tap on detection, tap again as the vehicle passes. Cancel discards a
vehicle that turned off. **Ambient noise sampling** records a 3-second median
baseline of "quiet"; any measurement started more than 6 dB above it is flagged,
because a warning time heard over a running engine is not one to rely on. Audio is
analysed on-device, never recorded or transmitted.

### Adaptive margin of error

Cindi asked for help with the mathematics. Implemented as behavioural shaping over
a rolling window of 10 attempts: **× 0.85 per step** when accuracy is ≥ 80%, hold
between 60–80%, step back to the last successful margin below 60%. Geometric so
each tightening is proportionally the same challenge; from 0.40 s it takes about
nine successful windows to reach the 0.10 s floor. Two successive failures pin a
learner floor at the last margin they held, which an instructor can clear.

### Progress and instructor reporting

Every attempt is logged on the device. A Progress screen shows accuracy per
activity and a strip of recent attempts. A plain-text report can be generated and
copied for the instructor — shown in full to the student first, never sent
automatically, with a one-tap delete for all history.

### Help and first-run tutorial

Separate guidance for clients and instructors, plus a tutorial that runs on first
launch and plays each sound with an explanation of what it means.

### Refactor

The single 3,137-line `index.html` was split into `index.html` (markup),
`css/app.css`, and five JavaScript modules. Still no build step. This was
necessary — the new work would have pushed one file past 5,000 lines.

### Environment

Xcode's update raised the minimum iOS deployment target from 14.0 to 15.0,
breaking the build. Fixed in the Podfile, the Xcode project, and with a
`post_install` hook that forces every Capacitor pod to the same minimum. This
build was verified by compiling against the device SDK and by full functional
testing in the browser.

## 2026-08-15 — Native iOS app, redesigned interface, project rename

### Renamed to "Gap Sense — Crossing Practice"

The project previously carried three different names at once: the page title said
"O&M Timing Practice Prototype", social metadata said "Street Timing Practice",
the repository was "Streets", and the on-screen heading said "Uncontrolled
Crossings". Settled on one name across the whole project.

| Context | Value |
|---|---|
| Full name | Gap Sense — Crossing Practice |
| Home-screen label / heading | Gap Sense (iOS truncates long labels) |
| Page subtitle | Crossing Practice |
| iOS bundle identifier | `com.gapsense.crossingpractice` |
| npm package | `gap-sense-crossing-practice` |

The earlier internal audit and fix-pass reports were left under the old
working titles as dated records. (They are no longer kept in this repository.)

### New: native iOS application (`ios-app/`)

Wrapped the app in a [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) shell, giving a real
iOS application that installs on a phone. Verified: `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`,
installed and launched on an iPhone 17 simulator running iOS 26.5.

**Why native rather than a web app:** `navigator.vibrate()` does not exist in
Safari on iOS and never has. For a DeafBlind user, vibration is the only feedback
channel available — so a web-only build cannot serve them at all. See
[`HAPTICS.md`](HAPTICS.md).

Added:
- **Real Taptic Engine haptics** via `@capacitor/haptics`, with automatic
  fallback to the Web Vibration API on Android and silent degradation elsewhere.
  A **Test haptic pulse** button and a live backend-detection note were added to
  the Accessibility panel.
- **Audio that survives the ringer switch.** Configured `AVAudioSession` to the
  `.playback` category in `AppDelegate.swift`. By default a WKWebView uses the
  `ambient` session, which the hardware silent switch mutes — a student at a
  corner with the switch flipped would have heard nothing and had no way to know
  why. `.mixWithOthers` keeps VoiceOver speech working alongside.
- **PWA support** — web manifest, service worker for offline use, generated app
  icons and a launch image.
- **`serve-lan.mjs`** — a dev server that prints a phone-reachable Wi-Fi address,
  so the app can be tested on a real iPhone without Xcode.

### Redesigned interface

Rebuilt the presentation layer. The timing engine, the AudioContext-clock replay
synchronization, the tuned sound presets, and the feedback-as-duration behavior
were carried over **unchanged**.

- Header with brand mark, card-based sections, segmented mode picker, progress
  chips, and a large gradient action button.
- **Stage identity is encoded four independent ways** — color, corner radius,
  border style, and symbol — so it is never carried by color alone.
- Every accent color verified at **≥4.5:1** contrast against the text on it, in
  all four themes. Gradients run dark→mid rather than dark→bright so white text
  stays legible across the whole sweep.
- High-contrast and inverted themes flatten every gradient.
- Large-text mode reflows the header, mode picker, and marker row to single
  columns at 130% and above.

### Three bugs fixed

1. **The marker cue banner was unreadable.** `emitCue("marker", …)` set the
   banner text, then `updateNextPrompt()` overwrote it on the very next
   statement. Both facts now live in one message: *"Halfway marked. Press Mark for
   Finish."*

2. **The progress-marker summary never reached screen readers.**
   `updateMarkersSummary()` carefully computed an `aria-label` such as "Progress
   markers: Start complete, Halfway current" — and set it on an element carrying
   `aria-hidden="true"`, which discarded it. Now `role="img"` plus `aria-label`,
   making the row one announceable unit.

3. **Feedback classification was computed twice.** `beginReplay()` calculated the
   margin/latency/epsilon comparison once for the audio schedule and again for the
   visual event list. If either copy were tuned, sound and visuals would silently
   disagree about what counted as acceptable. Now a single `classifyMark()` drives
   audio, visuals, cues, and haptics.

Also removed two functions (`showUserVisualPulse`, `showReferenceVisualPulse`)
that were defined but never called, and consolidated the duplicated
`getReferenceTimes` / `getReferenceTimesForMode` pair.

### Documentation

Added `docs/APP_GUIDE.md`, `docs/TESTING.md`, `docs/HAPTICS.md`, this changelog,
and `ios-app/README-IOS.md`. Rewrote the root `README.md` as a reviewer entry
point.

## 2026-07-08 — Fix pass

Summary:

- **Audio clarity.** `TEST_TUNING` had shipped with all four volume multipliers
  at the debug maximum of `2`, so feedback tones ran at gain 4× and the "outside"
  pulse peaked around 4.3× full scale — hard-clipped into distortion, which is
  why it sounded quieter and mushier rather than louder. Volumes reset to 1
  (0.8 for the button chime), every preset renormalized to a partial-gain sum
  ≤0.80, and a `DynamicsCompressorNode` master limiter added.
  The outside pulses were rebuilt: **240–260 Hz → 294–349 Hz** (small phone
  speakers roll off below ~300 Hz, so the old cue was partly lost inside the
  speaker), duration **0.12s → 0.30s**, and built from two closely spaced
  frequencies that beat against each other for a rough texture.
- **Dead marker cue.** `emitCue()` defined a `marker` cue with a vibration
  pattern that no call site ever fired — so with vibration enabled, tapping Mark
  did nothing. Fixed.
- **Dark-mode contrast** (issue `uc-3qz`). White on the dark theme's `#64d3bf`
  accent measured ~1.8:1, a hard WCAG failure. Added a per-theme `--on-accent`
  variable.
- **Forced-light invisible text.** Choosing Light while the OS was in dark mode
  rendered several buttons as white-on-white. Fixed with explicit `color-scheme`
  per theme.
- **Accessibility.** Added the first `<h1>` the page ever had; converted five
  unlabelled radio clusters to `<fieldset>`/`<legend>`.
- **Dead code removed.** A mute flag with no UI, the entire SFXR sound path
  (dead at both ends — no engine file, no data), a permanently hidden status
  element, and an unused npm dependency. 3,367 → 3,271 lines.
- **Documentation honesty.** The README had described a Next.js directory
  structure that does not exist in this repository. Rewritten.

## 2026-06-10 — Repository audit

No code changed. A full audit of the original single-file prototype covered correctness, accessibility readiness, PWA-versus-native tradeoffs, and a
prioritized improvement list. Most of the 2026-07-08 and 2026-08-15 work comes
directly from its recommendations.

---

## Before 2026-06-10

Original prototype development. Not under version control; no history available.
Preserved unmodified at `../index.html` apart from the rename.

---

## Outstanding

Known and deliberately not done yet:

- **No VoiceOver/TalkBack device pass**, including the open question of whether
  VoiceOver's double-tap-to-activate latency degrades marking accuracy, and
  whether focus-on-the-middle-answer is quick enough in Compare.
- **No roadside sound check.** The cues and the rising sample have only been
  heard through laptop and phone speakers indoors.
- **Two timing systems coexist.** Audio runs on the drift-free `AudioContext`
  clock; UI stage changes and haptics use `setTimeout`. On a loaded device they
  can drift apart slightly. The fix is to drive everything from the replay
  timeline.
- **Core Haptics** for intensity-shaped patterns, where buzz length would encode
  error size.
- **Cindi's fourth comparison step** is not yet specified.
- **Not on the App Store or Play Store.**
